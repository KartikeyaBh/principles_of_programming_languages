(* --- Homework 1, Part 2: Introduction to Coq, continued with Frap --- *)

(*
 * In this part of the homework, we get some practice with lists and other data structures
 * and use Frap tactics.
 *
 * Step through this file with CoqIDE (or another IDE for Coq), and complete the problems.
 * (Search for "PROBLEM" to be sure you find them all.)
 *
 * Throughout, we include the approximate lines of code (LOC) or number of tactics
 * for each of our solutions to these problems.  These are rough guidelines to help
 * you figure out if you are getting off-track.
 *
 * There is no penalty for writing a shorter or longer solution! However, if you find
 * yourself writing a much longer solution, see if you can figure out a simpler way.
 *
 *)

(* --- Making sure Frap is installed --- *)

(*
 * PROBLEM 0 [0 points, 0 LOC]
 * Set up Frap as described in README.md
 *
 * Once Coq is installed according to directions, you should be able to step over
 * the following line in your IDE.
 *)

Require Import Frap.
Set Implicit Arguments.

(* --- More arithmetic --- *)

(* This module creates a namespace where we can travel back in time to part 1.
 * Later in part 2, we're going to start using the Coq standard library version of
 * nat, so we hide our own definitions in this namespace so we can close it later.

(*
 * PROBLEM 3 [8 points, 2 clear yes/no answers and ~4 sentences of explanation]
 * Answer the following in ~1 sentence each.  If the bullet point starts with a yes/no question,
 * be sure to state your yes/no answer clearly before proceeding to explain.
 *
 *   - Why does `linear_arithmetic` succeed on `add_comm_again`, but fail on `mult_comm_again`?
       Linear_arithmetic supports only addition. It supports multiplication by constants. 

 *   - Why does `ring` succeed on `mult_comm_again`?
       Ring is used to normalize any ring structure(i.e. structures having rings and semi-rings
       like x(3+yx+25(1âˆ’z))+zx). A ring in a basic sense satisfies
       all the properties of addition and multiplication. The basic use of ring is to simplify 
       ring expressions, so that the user does not have to deal manually with the 
       theorems of associativity and commutativity. In a ring structure, associativity and 
       distributivity of multiplication is supported.

 *   - Will `ring` succeed on `add_comm_again`? Why or why not?
       It will succeed. In ring structure addition is commutative and associative.

 *   - Is `ring` always more powerful than `linear_arithmetic`? Why or why not?
       I think 'ring' is a superset of linear arithmetic. So it should be more powerful than
       linear_arithmetic always.

(* --- Curry-Howard practice --- *)

Module curry_howard.
(*
 * In lecture, we looked at an inductive definition of the types `True` and `False`,
 * and talked about how they encode logical ideas as types.
 *
 * One of the deep connections in type theory is between logic and programming.
 * In fact, there are programming analogues to `True` and `False`.
 *)

Inductive unit : Type :=
| tt : unit.

Inductive empty : Type :=
.

(*
 * PROBLEM 4 [5 points, 1-2 sentences]
 * Explain in your own words the relationship between `unit` and `True`, and between
 * `empty` and `False`.
   unit is just any type. Whenever a label "tt" occurs we specify it as true.
   "empty" is a type which does not match to anything. So we cannot create false 
   from anything.
 *)

(*
 * Here are two ways of defining the identity function on `unit`.
 *)

Definition unit_id1 (x : unit) : unit := x.  (* first way: just return the argument *)
Definition unit_id2 (x : unit) : unit :=
  match x with (* second way: take the argument apart and put it back together again *)
  | tt => tt
  end.

(*
 * PROBLEM 5 [5 points, ~3 tactics]
 * Prove that the two definition of the identity function on `unit` are the same
 * by proving the following lemma.

Lemma unit_id_same :

(*
 * By analogy, we can also present two different proofs that True implies True.

(*
 * We can ask Coq to print definitions using the `Print` command. This works
 * not only for things defined with Definition/Fixpoint, but also for things
 * defined via Lemma/Theorem.
 *
 * Coq prints things in a "de-sugared" form, with more type annotations, but
 * usually it's pretty easy to see how it corresponds to what you wrote.
 *)

Print unit_id1.
(*
 * This command prints `fun x : unit => x`, which is syntax for a function
 * that takes an argument `x` of type `unit` and just returns it,  which
 * is exactly what we wrote in the definition of `unit_id1`.
 *)


(*
 * We can also ask Coq to print the underlying proof term for the lemma
 * `True_implies_True1`.
 *)
Print True_implies_True1.

(*
 * We can similarly print the definitions for the second versions.

Print unit_id2.

(*
 * PROBLEM 6 [8 points, 2 proofs, each with <5 tactics, and 2 definitions, each with <5 LOC]
 * Prove that False implies False in two different ways, one that just takes
 * the evidence of False and uses it directly, and one which takes it apart
 * and puts it back together again.
 *
 * For each proof, also print its proof term using the Print command. If you
 * see anything interesting or surprising, write a comment here. (worth 0 pts)
 *
 * Then, define two identity functions on `empty`, one which just returns its argument,
 * and one which takes its argument apart and puts it back together again.
 *
 * Hint: If you're stuck on the definitions, you can work by analogy to the proof terms
 * you saw by using the Print command on your proofs.
